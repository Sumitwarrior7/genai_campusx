# Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR)
# "How can we pick results that are not only relevant to the query but also different from each other?"

# MMR is an information retrieval algorithm designed to reduce redundancy in the retrieved results while maintaining high relevance to the query.

# ðŸ¤” Why MMR Retriever?

# In regular similarity search, you may get documents that are:
# - All very similar to each other
# - Repeating the same info
# - Lacking diverse perspectives

# MMR Retriever avoids that by:
# - Picking the most relevant document first
# - Then picking the next most relevant and least similar to already selected docs
# - And so on...

# This helps especially in RAG pipelines where:
# - You want your context window to contain diverse but still relevant information
# - Especially useful when documents are semantically overlapping
