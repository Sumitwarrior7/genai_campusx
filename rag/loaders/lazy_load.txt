Load vs Lazy Load

âœ… load()
Eager Loading (loads everything at once).
Returns: A list of Document objects.
Loads all documents immediately into memory.

Best when:
The number of documents is small.
You want everything loaded upfront.


ðŸŒ€ lazy_load()
Lazy Loading (loads on demand).
Returns: A generator of Document objects.
Documents are not all loaded at once; they're fetched one at a time as needed.

Best when:
You're dealing with large documents or lots of files.
You want to stream processing (e.g., chunking, embedding) without using lots of memory.
